# Overview

This is a version of the package [cryptography](https://pub.dev/packages/cryptography) that
optimizes performance of some cryptographic algorithms by using native APIs of Android, iOS, and
Mac OS X. You must use asynchronous methods to get the performance boost.

# Getting started
In _pubspec.yaml_:
```yaml
dependencies:
  cryptography: ^2.0.5
  cryptography_flutter: ^2.0.2
```

Then just use:
```dart
import 'package:better_cryptography_flutter/cryptography_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Enable Flutter cryptography
  FlutterCryptography.enable();

  // ....
}
```

For APIs, read documentation for [package:better_cryptography](https://pub.dev/packages/cryptography).

# Contributing?
