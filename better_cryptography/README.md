# Overview
Popular cryptographic algorithms for [Dart](https://dart.dev) / [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
developers.

Maintained by Gohilla Ltd. Licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

This package is:
  * __Easy to use__. The API is easy to understand and encourages good defaults.
  * __Multi-platform__. It's easy to customize implementation of X in platform Y.
  * __Fast.__ By default, we use platform APIs when available. For example, SHA-512 is over 100
    times faster than _package:crypto_ in browsers.

Any feedback, issue reports, or pull requests are appreciated!

# Key concepts
## Key classes
The usual arguments to algorithms are:
  * [SecretKeyData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SecretKeyData-class.html)
    is used by ciphers, message authentication codes, and key derivation functions.
  * [KeyPair](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/KeyPair-class.html) and
    [PublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/PublicKey-class.html)
    are used by key exchange and signature algorithms.
      * [SimpleKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SimpleKeyPairData-class.html)
        and [SimplePublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SimplePublicKey-class.html)
        are used when keys are simple byte sequences.
      * [EcKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/EcKeyPairData-class.html)
        and [EcPublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/EcPublicKey-class.html)
        are used by P-256 / P-384 / P-512 algorithms.
      * [RsaKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/RsaKeyPairData-class.html)
        and [RsaPublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/RsaPublicKey-class.html)
        are used by RSA algorithms.
      * For encoding/decoding private/public keys in JWK (JSON Web Key) format, use
        [package:jwk](https://pub.dev/packages/jwk).
      * For encoding/decoding X.509, PKCS12, and other formats, we don't have recommended packages
        at the moment.

## Available implementations
The abstract class [Cryptography](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Cryptography-class.html)
has factory methods that return implementations of cryptographic algorithms. The default
implementation is _BrowserCryptography_ (which works in all platforms, not just browser). You can
write your own _Cryptography_ subclass if you need to.

We wrote the following three implementations of `Cryptography`:
  * [DartCryptography](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography.dart/DartCryptography-class.html)
    * Gives you implementations written in pure Dart implementations. They work in all platforms.
    * SHA1 / SHA2 uses implementation in [package:crypto](https://pub.dev/packages/crypto), which
      is maintained by Google. The rest of the algorithms in _DartCryptography_ are written and tested by us.
    * _DartCryptography_ gives:

# Getting started
In _pubspec.yaml_:
```yaml
dependencies:
  cryptography: ^2.0.5
```

If you use Flutter, we recommend that you also add [cryptography_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/cryptography_flutter):
```yaml
dependencies:
  cryptography: ^2.0.5
  cryptography_flutter: ^2.0.2
```

# Examples
## Digital signature
In this example, we use [Ed25519](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Ed25519-class.html).

```dart
import 'package:better_cryptography/better_cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // The message that we will sign
  final message = <int>[1,2,3];

  // Generate a keypair.
  final algorithm = Ed25519();
  final keyPair = await algorithm.newKeyPair();

  // Sign
  final signature = await algorithm.sign(
    message,
    keyPair: keyPair,
  );
  print('Signature: ${signature.bytes}');
  print('Public key: ${signature.publicKey.bytes}');

  // Verify signature
  final isSignatureCorrect = await algorithm.verify(
    message,
    signature: signature,
  );
  print('Correct signature: $isSignatureCorrect');
}
```

## Key agreement
In this example, we use [X25519](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/X25519-class.html).

```dart
import 'package:better_cryptography/better_cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final algorithm = X25519();

  // Alice chooses her key pair
  final aliceKeyPair = await algorithm.newKeyPair();

  // Alice knows Bob's public key
  final bobKeyPair = await algorithm.newKeyPair();
  final bobPublicKey = await bobKeyPair.extractPublicKey();

  // Alice calculates the shared secret.
  final sharedSecret = await algorithm.sharedSecretKey(
    keyPair: aliceKeyPair,
    remotePublicKey: bobPublicKey,
  );
  final sharedSecretBytes = await aliceKeyPair.extractBytes();
  print('Shared secret: $sharedSecretBytes');
}
```

## Authenticated encryption
In this example, we encrypt a message with [AesCtr](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/AesCtr-class.html)
and append a [Hmac](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Hmac-class.html)
message authentication code.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:better_cryptography/better_cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // Message we want to encrypt
  final message = utf8.encode('Hello encryption!');

  // Choose the cipher
  final algorithm = AesCtr(macAlgorithm: Hmac.sha256()));

  // Generate a random secret key.
  final secretKey = algorithm.newSecretKey();
  final secretKeyBytes = await secretKey.extractBytes();
  print('Secret key: ${secretKeyBytes}');

  // Encrypt
  final secretBox = await algorithm.encrypt(
    message,
    secretKey: secretKey,
  );
  print('Nonce: ${secretBox.nonce}');
  print('Ciphertext: ${secretBox.cipherText}');
  print('MAC: ${secretBox.mac.bytes}');

  // Decrypt
  final clearText = await algorithm.decrypt(
    secretBox,
    secretKey: secretKey,
  );
  print('Cleartext: ${utf8.decode(clearText)}');
}
```

## Hashing
In this example, we use [Sha512](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Sha512-class.html).

```dart
import 'package:better_cryptography/better_cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final sink = Sha512().newHashSink();

  // Add all parts of the authenticated message
  sink.add([1,2,3]);
  sink.add([4,5]);

  // Calculate hash
  sink.close();
  final hash = await sink.hash();

  print('SHA-512 hash: ${hash.bytes}');
}
```
